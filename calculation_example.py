## Just applying variables
a = 3           #
b = sin(2)      #

## Working with terms
a       #
a+b     #
2+2+2+2+2 #


## Calculate the normal vector

## Given a vector like
v = (100,20)

## We can calculate normal vector by first calculating its length
l = sqrt(v[0]**2 + v[1]**2) #

## And then dividing each number with the length
v_ = [x/l for x in v] #


a+b+2345+sin(3456)   #
